    </li>In 1983 the first 1G cellular network launched in the United States. It weighed around 2 pounds and provided 30 minutes of talk time. It took around 10  hours to charge.Although the cellphone prototype was made in 1973 (10 years before the North American launch of 1G), Motorola introduced the first commercially available cellphone to the public in 1983 -the DynaTAC.<h1 style="color: black;">Milestone 2</h1>

</li>The 2G launched in Finlamd on 1991. It ptovided significant mobile talk advancements.It improved quality, reduced static and crackling noises while you were talking. 2G gave us some basic smartphone functionality. However, that wasn’t the most state-of-the-art benefit of this data transfer feature. In fact, 2G’s data transferring completely changed how we communicate by introducing text messages (SMS) and multimedia messages (MMS) as new forms of communication.<h1 style="color: grey;">Milestone 3</h1>

</li>The 3G was introduced in 2001  3G focused on standardizing vendors’ network protocol. In turn, users could access data from anywhere, which allowed international roaming services to begin. What made 3G revolutionary, though, was the ability to surf the internet (basic HTML pages at the time) and stream music on mobile. Although 2G did offer the same features, they weren’t as advanced as what 3G had in terms of download speed.   <h1 style="color: black;">Milestone 4</h1>

4G WAS INTRODUCED IN IN 2009 provided high-quality video streaming/chat, fast mobile web access, HD videos, and online gaming. Compared to a simple SIM card switch from 2G to 3G, mobile devices needed to be specifically designed to support 4G. .
<h1 style="color: white;">Milestone 5</h1><li>South Korea was the first country to offer 5G in March 2019. The 5th generation was rolled out by KT, LG Uplus, and SK Telecom – all South Korean telecom providers. 5G in Canada has already been introduced in major cities.5G latency is incredibly reduced, which increases faster download and upload speeds. Comparing the two, 4G has an average latency of around 50 milliseconds, whereas 5G’s average latency is expected to be about 10 </li>
